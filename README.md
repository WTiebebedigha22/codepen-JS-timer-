Week 2 ‚Äî  Completed
Timers
It's week two of our JavaScript Classics challenge!

Last week, we got started with a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Play through the Pens from week one in our #CodePenChallenge: Rock, Paper, Scissors collection.

This week, we'll work with another classic challenge for JS developers ‚Äî timers!

Time handling in general is time-honored challenge for developers of all kinds, and building a timer in JavaScript gives you a chance to learn the basics (and a little bit about the complexity) of time in JS while building something practical. Plus, you'll develop some HTML & CSS chops if you make it user-friendly and good-looking, too.

Ideas
This week's template includes the basic HTML & CSS layout for a simple stopwatch timer, but you'll notice right away that it doesn't do anything at all. That's where you come in! As you jump into the JS, it can help to brush up on the Date.now() object, and the SetInterval and ClearInterval methods.
Try building a Pomodoro timer üçÖ The Pomodoro technique is a simple focus tool that alternates between time for focused work and time for breaks. You usually do 4 sessions of work with a short break between each session, then one longer break after your 5th session. To build a Pomodoro-style Pen, you'd want to track time for both focus and break sessions, and keep a tally of how many work and break sessions the user has done.
Create a countdown timer ‚è≥ You could do a countdown to a specific time or date, or something different like a gaming-style "cooldown" timer. With a countdown timer, a big part of the challenge is keeping it interesting while the time counts down, especially for longer counters. Perhaps you could make it look like a real timepiece, like an hourglass with animated sand, or have some mini-milestones where something change on the page as the timer counts down.
